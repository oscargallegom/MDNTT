<p class="text_left_content">The Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) has scheduled a series of
educational meetings to provide an overview of the new Maryland Nutrient
Trading Program and introduce its web-based nutrient credit assessment tool,
marketplace, and registry. Governor Martin O?Malley signed House Bill 974 into
law this week, which enables the exchange (buying and selling) of nutrient
reduction credits that have monetary value to help reduce nitrogen and
phosphorus in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.</p>

<p class="text_left_content">All meetings will be moderated by Mark M. Bundy, Ph.D., who is the former Director
of Education, Bay Policy, and Growth Management Services at the Maryland
Department of Natural Resources and a current member of the Maryland Green
Building Council.   Dr. Bundy facilitated the two-year process which drew upon
the expertise of a diverse group of stakeholders from state agencies, regional
and national organizations, and private industry to develop the principles,
policies, and tools for  Maryland?s nutrient trading program.  Staff from MDA?s
Office of Resource Conservation will be joined by representatives from the
Maryland Department of the Environment, the World Resources Institute, the
