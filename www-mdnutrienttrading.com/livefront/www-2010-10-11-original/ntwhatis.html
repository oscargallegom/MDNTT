</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<p class= "text_left_content">Maryland&rsquo;s Nutrient Trading Program is a public market place for the buying and selling of nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorous) credits.  
The purpose of the Program ranges from being able to offset new or increased discharges to establishing economic incentives for reductions from all 
sources within a watershed and to achieve greater environmental benefits than through the existing regulatory programs.  &nbsp;
</p>

<p class= "text_left_content">In January 2008, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) issued a policy document entitled 
<a href="http://www.mde.state.md.us/Water/nutrientcap.asp">&ldquo;Maryland Policy for Nutrient Cap Management and Trading in Maryland&rsquo;s Chesapeake Bay Watershed&rdquo;</a> 
that represented the initial phase of the State&rsquo;s policy development on nutrient trading (and is referred to as Phase I).  That document described the purpose and form of 
nutrient trading in Maryland and set forth the fundamental principles and guidelines that Maryland will require trading programs to adhere to.  It also spelled out the requirements 
and procedures for nutrient trades between wastewater treatment plants (point source-point source trading).  With the issuance of this policy, wastewater treatment plants could begin 
requesting approval for trades with other wastewater treatment plants.    
</p>

<p class= "text_left_content">Phase II was initiated by the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) in the fall of 2007 to address the opportunity for trading between point and 
nonpoint sources, such as agricultural operations.  The requirements and procedures for point&mdash;nonpoint agricultural trading were issued in April 2008 in two draft documents: 
<i>The Maryland Policy for Nutrient Cap Management and Trading in Maryland&rsquo;s Chesapeake Bay Watershed </i><i>
<a href="../../mdnutrienttrading.org/docs/Phase%20II-A_Crdt%20Generation-2.html">Phase II A&mdash;Guidelines for the Generation of Agricultural Nonpoint Nutrient Credits</a></i>, and 
<i><a href="../../mdnutrienttrading.org/docs/Phase%20II-B_Crdt%20Purchase-2.html">Phase II B&mdash;Guidelines for Agricultural Nonpoint Credit Purchases</a></i>
</p>

<p Align="center" class= "text_left_content"><b><a name="PointSource">Point Source Trading</a></b>
</p>

<p class= "text_left_content">The key principles of the <a href="http://www.mde.state.md.us/Water/nutrientcap.asp">Phase I - Point Source Trading policy</a> are basic. They call for all new and expanded 
point source nutrient loads to be fully offset, require that all trades be consistent with local county water and sewerage plans and sewerage plans, and do not allow trading in 
lieu of required Enhanced Nutrient Removal upgrades.  In addition, point source trades will be implemented and enforced via NPDES permits and trades have to be consistent with TMDLs.  
The cornerstone of the policy&rsquo;s key principles is that trades must protect local water quality as well as provide adequate public outreach/stakeholder participation.  
The Phase I Policy also addressed point source baseline requirements. 
</p>


<p class= "text_left_content">How will this trading be structured? It will be broken down to &ldquo;Units of Trade&rdquo; called a credit, which is equal to one pound of nitrogen 
or phosphorus delivered to the main stem of the Bay per year.  Credits will be traded within defined trading areas.  At this time these areas are defined as: the Potomac basin; the 
Patuxent basin; and everywhere else within the state.
</p>

<p class= "text_left_content">Credits can be generated in a variety of ways.   These include upgrading an existing minor wastewater treatment plant to BNR (Biological Nutrient Removal) or ENR (Enhanced Nutrient Removal).  
Also, an existing wastewater plant can be retired and have it&rsquo;s flow sent to a BNR or ENR facility or retire an existing Onsite Sewage Disposal System (OSDS) by connection to public sewer
or cluster treatment.  Enhanced Nutrient Removal facilities may generate point sources discharge credits by reducing effluent concentration or maintaining flow at less than the design flow basis 
of the waste load allocation.  Also, a facility may opt to have <a name="OLE_LINK1"></a>land application of wastewater with pretreatment and nutrient management controls.
</p>

<p class= "text_left_content">If you have an OSDS there is a way to earn nitrogen credit.  The credit calculation for an OSDS assumes hookup to a WWTP discharging nitrogen at 4 mg/L.  If the System is within 
the Critical Area the potential credits are 12.2 lbs/yr; if it is within 1,000 feet of any perennial surface water the credit would be 7.5 lbs/yr; and then 4.6 lbs/yr everywhere else. 
It should be noted that Commercial OSDS credits will be higher and determined on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;
</p>

<p class= "text_left_content">One of many important elements is how long the trades will last &ndash; or it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Trade Duration&rdquo;. The wastewater treatment plants will 
strive to buy credits to offset growth. The agreements they make will be a contractual arrangement that will last for 10 years. During this time they will also develop a plan that will 
put them into a position to acquire the credits for the next 10 years after the initial contract has expired.
</p>

<p  align="center" class= "text_left_content"><a name="NonPointSource"><b>Nonpoint Source Trading</b></a></p>

<p  class= "text_left_content">Maryland&rsquo;s Phase II Trading Program&rsquo;s is directed towards the inclusion of Agriculture into the process. That is where 
point source and agricultural nonpoint source can start trading.
</p>

<p class= "text_left_content">Policies have been developed that define two basic components of this phase of the program. They provide guidelines for the 
<a href="../../mdnutrienttrading.org/docs/Phase%20II-A_Crdt%20Generation-2.html">Generation of Agricultural Nonpoint Credits</a> (selling credits), and guidelines for the 
<a href="../../mdnutrienttrading.org/docs/Phase%20II-B_Crdt%20Purchase-2.html">Exchange of Agricultural Nonpoint Credits</a> (buying credits).
</p>

<p class= "text_left_content">One of the key principles established for Agricultural Nonpoint Source Credit Generation is that agricultural operations must first meet baseline requirements 
before generating credits.  Farm operations must meet the level of nutrient reduction called for in the <a href="http://www.dnr.state.md.us/Bay/tribstrat">Tributary Strategy</a> for their 
basin.  Where a TMDL is required, they must meet the level of reduction prescribed in the related documents.  Additionally, credit generators must be in compliance with all federal, state 
and local laws and regulations.
</p>

<p class= "text_left_content">For agricultural operations, certain agronomic practices including: cover crops, reduced fertilizer application, and manure export, along with structural BMPs 
(riparian buffers, livestock fencing, etc.) are eligible as credits.  To qualify as credits these practices will be certified and inspected by MDA personnel.  They also must be built and 
operated according to USDA, NRCS specifications. Each practice will have an annual verification carried out by technically competent reviewers who may be representing the state, a third party, 
or the seller.  This verification will insure that the BMP or practice is being maintained in accordance with the specifications.  Credits will only be generated once the BMP is installed 
and functioning as designed and approved.  Local Soil Conservation Districts can help farmers and landowners with information and provide assistance to those who may be interested in participating 
in the program.
</p>

<p class= "text_left_content">Landowners or farmers can&rsquo;t use federal or state cost-share funds to generate credits and can&rsquo;t generate credits by taking and retiring farmland. 
All reductions must result in a net decrease in nutrient loads entering the water, and be consistent with the Phase I Point Source trading policy requiring a 5% retirement ratio. 
(See the <a href="http://www.mde.state.md.us/Water/nutrientcap.asp">Phase I - Point Source Trading Policy</a> for details.)
</p>

<p class= "text_left_content">To participate in the Agricultural Nonpoint Source component of Maryland&rsquo;s Nutrient Trading Program, landowners, farmers or aggregators will utilize a 
web-based <a href="http://md-stage.nutrientnet.org/">nutrient trading application tool</a> to calculate baseline eligibility and credit potential. This will help the farmer determine if 
he&rsquo;d be interested in pursuing the process.  This web-based tool is part of the Maryland Nutrient Trading Program&rsquo;s 
<a href="http://md-stage.nutrientnet.org/marketplace/list.app">Market Place</a> for buyers and sellers of approved credits.  In the Market Place participants can post and exchange information 
on credit availability, credits desired, quantity and price.  To enable effective management and communication of Maryland&rsquo;s Nutrient Trading Program, the Market Place will include a 
<a href="http://md-stage.nutrientnet.org/trade/list.app">Trading Registry</a> that will catalogue all registered credits and approved trades.
